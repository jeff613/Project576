To run this project you need two parameters:

Location of video file
Location of audio file


To integrate this with color indexing algorithm:

Call the algorithm from the Search button pressed event.
Once the result is computed, call the 'loadResults' function with the path of the strip to load (full path) and the frame number (0-720) to select.
The new strip will be loaded and the frame will appear selected.
